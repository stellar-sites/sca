SCA is governed by a self-perpetuating Board of Trustees, consisting of parents and local business people, which is vested with the management of the business affairs of the school.</p> <p>SCA is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and it is fully supported through the tuition which families pay as well as through generous donations from churches, businesses and individuals. Donations of materials, services, property, stock/bonds, and cash are always welcome. Donations are tax deductible to the extent granted by state and federal law.</p> <p>Since the school's founding as Christian School of Southern York County, the academically qualified teachers at SCA have been committed to investing in the lives of the students which we serve to help those students mature spiritually, academically, socially and physically.</p> <p>Dallastown, Red Lion, South Eastern, South Western and Southern school districts within York county provide public school bus transportation to SCA students at no charge.</p> <p>Call us at (717) 235-5763 or submit our online contact form to learn more about the school, our standards of excellence &amp; passion for Christ, and the admissions process.</p> <h1 id="history"><a href="#history" class="header-anchor">#</a> History</h1> <p>Shrewsbury Christian Academy was founded by Jeanette Harvey in 1977 as a ministry to the community, welcoming students from a variety of backgrounds and denominations. Over the years, the school has continued to grow in numbers, programs, and reputation. The school has always remained committed to providing a unique Bible-based, Christ-centered education that prepares young people to impact their world for Jesus and help develop a Christian worldview that will be lived out in real and meaningful ways. The need for a Christian school in this community has not diminished, but continues to strengthen in the context of a world where Christian values and commitments are increasingly pushed aside, especially in the country’s educational system.</p> <h1 id="vision-statement"><a href="#vision-statement" class="header-anchor">#</a> Vision Statement</h1> <p>Achieving excellence in knowledge and faith.</p> <h1 id="mission-statement"><a href="#mission-statement" class="header-anchor">#</a> Mission Statement</h1> <p>Educating students in a Christian environment that reveals God’s ultimate purpose for their lives.</p> <h1 id="statement-of-faith"><a href="#statement-of-faith" class="header-anchor">#</a> Statement of Faith</h1> <ul><li>We believe in the divine inspiration, infallibility, and the final authority of the Bible as the Word of God.

(Romans 3:21-30; Galatians 4:4-7)</li> <li>We believe in the Holy Spirit, through Whom we come to faith in Christ and Who enables us daily to grow in grace. (Luke 7:50; 18:42; John 3:15; Ephesians 2:8-9)</li> <li>We believe in the resurrection of the crucified body of our Lord, and that blessed hope, His personal return. (Matthew 16:21; 17:9; John 11:25; Philippians 1:10)</li> <li>We believe in the bodily resurrection of the just and the unjust, the everlasting blessedness of the saved and the everlasting punishment of the lost.
