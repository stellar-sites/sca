By examining God’s Word across the curriculum, students learn that they are created in His image, and they can know God as revealed in Christ, who was made present through the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35). Our commitment to academic excellence challenges us to incorporate these spiritual goals into the traditional disciplines of education.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Shrewsbury Christian Academy implements a wide variety of curriculum in order to accomplish outlined educational learning objectives.  Teachers utilize outside resources to enhance the curriculum.  Students are engaged in the learning process and invited to be active participants.  All grades begin with pledges to God, the Bible, and the United States of America. In each grade we explore the Bible through lessons from Genesis to Revelation at various grade levels.</p></blockquote> <p>We offer weekly enrichment classes to all students in kindergarten through grade eight. These classes include instruction in art, music, physical education and computer technology. Students are introduced to classical artists and modern painters through the world of art in weekly classes.  Music is another area of the fine arts.  Students develop an awareness of classical composers and enjoy American folk songs as well.  There is one gym class per week for all grades.  Third through eighth grade students take Spanish class. All grades visit the SCA library regularly and participate in chapel services throughout the school year.</p> <h1 id="pre-school-3-and-4-year-old"><a href="#pre-school-3-and-4-year-old" class="header-anchor">#</a> Pre-School (3 and 4 Year Old)</h1> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>To learn more out SCA's pre-school program, please <a href="/assets/files/sca-preschool.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p></div> <h1 id="early-childhood-k-–-2nd-grade"><a href="#early-childhood-k-–-2nd-grade" class="header-anchor">#</a> Early Childhood (K – 2nd Grade)</h1> <h3 id="bible"><a href="#bible" class="header-anchor">#</a> Bible</h3> <p>Students receive direct Bible instruction, even though biblical principles are integrated throughout the day. Students study God’s Word, memorize Scripture and learn to apply God’s instruction to their own lives. Teachers use the Positive Action for Christ curriculum as a framework.</p> <h3 id="language-arts"><a href="#language-arts" class="header-anchor">#</a> Language Arts</h3> <p>SCA combines a strong phonics program with elements of whole language while using strategies that are rich in a variety of literature and creative writing experiences which we believe to be the best approach to teaching reading. Students in the first grade (2nd semester), second grade, and third grade receive reading instruction through the Foundations &amp; Frameworks reading program.  Foundations &amp; Frameworks is an instructional reading program that uses quality literature to address the following elements of reading: vocabulary, fluency and reading comprehension.</p> <p>Invented spelling is encouraged in kindergarten where students apply their knowledge of phonics. Kindergartners also use sight word lists, charts and graphic organizers to help them spell words. Formal spelling instruction begins in first grade. Children learn spelling rules, develop good study habits and practice dictionary skills.</p> <p>Students are introduced to grammar skills beginning in the first grade. Grammar rules are taught and reinforced during daily grammar instruction and applied during creative writing experiences.</p> <h3 id="handwriting-penmanship"><a href="#handwriting-penmanship" class="header-anchor">#</a> Handwriting/Penmanship</h3> <p>Through the use of developmentally appropriate activities, children in kindergarten establish hand dominance and practice writing letters and numerals in proper formation. First and second graders continue to practice manuscript within a curriculum that reinforces phonics rules and Scripture. Second grade students begin learning cursive in late fall and progress to cursive independence by the end of the school year.</p> <h3 id="math"><a href="#math" class="header-anchor">#</a> Math</h3> <p>The use of manipulatives, math games, and a variety of math reproducibles are used to lay a strong foundation of mathematical concepts in Kindergarten.  Beginning in first grade, math concepts are taught through the Saxon math curriculum.  The use of manipulatives, the application of reasoning skills, and problem solving strategies help reflect God’s order and unchanging attributes.</p> <h3 id="social-studies"><a href="#social-studies" class="header-anchor">#</a> Social Studies</h3> <p>The kindergarten social studies curriculum helps students develop a strong awareness and understanding of the world around them through the exploration of themed units. In first grade, the social studies curriculum expands the students’ understanding of people, geography, community and citizenship. Second graders continue to study geography and communities and are introduced to American history with an emphasis on the establishment of our nation, famous leaders of the past, and government.</p> <h3 id="science"><a href="#science" class="header-anchor">#</a> Science</h3> <p>Based on the biblical truth that God has created all living things, kindergarten children learn through observation and investigation the intricate details of His creation. First and second graders continue to use their senses to make careful observations, ask questions, form hypotheses, and test them through experimentation. Areas of life science, physical science, earth and space science, and health and safety are introduced.</p> <h3 id="technology-program"><a href="#technology-program" class="header-anchor">#</a> Technology Program</h3> <p>The goal of Shrewsbury Christian Academy’s technology program is to equip students with the computer skills that they will need to be successful in high school, college and future careers.  The program is integrated with what the students are learning in the classroom.  Students work on one project per marking period, and each project is based in one of the four primary Microsoft office programs.  Kindergarten through second grade begins with basic skills such as:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre><code>locating and opening a file

Third through fifth grades use the Positive Action for Christ curriculum.</p> <p>Third grade studies the Old Testament stories of Abraham, Jacob, Joseph and Daniel.  By studying these great heroes of faith, children grow in their own daily walk with God.</p> <p>The fourth grade focus is on the life of Jesus Christ, the work of the Holy Spirit and a study of Paul and his missionary journeys.  Students gain a deeper understanding of obedience to God.</p> <p>The fifth grade curriculum is a survey of the Old Testament.  Children learn that just as God desired His people to possess the land of Canaan, so He desires His children to live a life of promise and victory.</p> <h3 id="language-arts-2"><a href="#language-arts-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Language Arts</h3> <p>Students in third, fourth and fifth grades receive reading instruction through the Foundations &amp; Frameworks reading program.  Foundations &amp; Frameworks is an instructional reading program that uses quality literature to address the following elements of reading: vocabulary, fluency and reading comprehension.</p> <p>Through the use of the five stages of the writing process, students are encouraged to express their thoughts clearly to their intended audience. Students write for different purposes as they demonstrate the proper use of grammar use and word usage. Other elements of grammar are practiced and reviewed daily.</p> <p>Elementary students receive formal spelling instruction five days a week. The spelling program helps students increase their spelling capacity, in addition to building vocabulary and study skills. Book reports are written quarterly.</p> <h3 id="handwriting-penmanship-2"><a href="#handwriting-penmanship-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Handwriting/Penmanship</h3> <p>Third grade continues practicing cursive and progresses to mastery throughout the school year.</p> <h3 id="math-2"><a href="#math-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Math</h3> <p>We use ACSI’s Purposeful Design Math curriculum in the third and fourth grades. The fifth grade class uses the Saxon curriculum.  Grade level computation skills are reviewed and drilled, problem solving skills are addressed at every level, and a grade appropriate understanding of algebraic concepts, geometry, and measurement are developed. Children recognize that our God is a God of order and consistency through the orderliness of math.</p> <h3 id="social-studies-2"><a href="#social-studies-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Social Studies</h3> <p>God created us as social beings to commune with Him and with one another. The third grade Social Studies curriculum defines community in relation to geography, government and economics. In fourth grade, students study the geography and history of the four major regions of the United States. Since students enrolled at SCA live in Pennsylvania and Maryland, students complete a report for their respective state. While they engage in the study of American History, fifth graders gain awareness and appreciation of God’s providence as He has guided our leaders and blessed our nation.</p> <h3 id="science-2"><a href="#science-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Science</h3> <p>Elementary students continue to investigate the wonders of God’s creation through hands-on learning opportunities.

The lessons learned through Daring Deliverers are current and applicable to events of today and remind students that God is in control and nothing takes Him by surprise.</p> <p>A worldview is an overall perspective from which one sees and interprets the world.  At Shrewsbury Christian Academy, we teach from a Biblical worldview striving to equip our students to be confident and grounded in the Christian faith.  This focus is especially important in the middle school grades.  The 7th grade Bible curriculum To the Ends of the Earth is designed to teach principles for Christian living from the primitive church as recorded in the books of Acts, and the 8th grade Bible curriculum Lightbearers is designed to help students clearly understand the tenets of the Christian worldview and how they compare to the tenets of the leading postmodern worldviews of our day.  Students will learn how to apply their Christian faith to every area of life: theology, philosophy, ethics, biology, sociology, law, politics, economics and history.</p> <h3 id="literature"><a href="#literature" class="header-anchor">#</a> Literature</h3> <p>Middle school students receive reading instruction through the Foundations &amp; Frameworks reading program.
