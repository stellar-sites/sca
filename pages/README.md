Located in Southern York County, Pennsylvania, Shrewsbury Christian Academy offers a Christ-centered education for preschool through eighth grade. We are an independent, non denominational Christian school which is solely funded through student tuition and donations from local businesses, churches, and individuals.

Our students come from York county, Pennsylvania as well as from Baltimore & Harford counties in Maryland. Since 1977, our faculty have invested themselves into the lives of our young people in order to help them succeed spiritually, intellectually, physically, emotionally and socially.
