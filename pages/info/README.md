Shrewsbury Christian Academy is registered with the PA Department of Education and is a member of the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI). 
The school is governed by a self-perpetuating Board of Trustees who are vested with the management of the business affairs of the school.

## Chapel

<Photo :src="$withBase('/assets/img/diligent-students_orig.jpg')" float="left" />
Students attend chapel services once each week. Parents are welcome to worship with us at chapel services anytime.
All students are encouraged to attend worship and Sunday school with their families at their own churches. We believe that attendance at a Christian school is not a substitute for Sunday worship. Christian education occurs in both places so that each complements and supplements the other.
