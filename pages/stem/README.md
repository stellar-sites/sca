# STEM
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (including Computer Science)

# Science
CA science curriculum is designed to challenge our students while making it fun to learn.  
Our Middle School science curriculum was especially developed to prepare our students to properly transition to the most challenging high school science programs in the area.  

Highlights of the program include:

:::: tabs

::: tab "Environmental Science"
### Environmental Science
We augment the typical textbook instruction with the materials provided by the York County Envirothon program.  
The instruction reveals the wonders of God's creation with a combination of classroom instruction and hands-on learning.

Shrewsbury Christian Academy's Envirothon teams have regularly won awards at the Annual York County competition with 30+ schools competing. 
:::

::: tab Biology
### Biology
The students are introduced to the physiology of plants and animals, biological processes, and anatomy.  Laboratory dissections are an integral part of the curriculum. 
:::

::: tab Physics
### Physics
The students are introduced to the concepts of basic physics.  Typical hands-on projects include designing and building a marble coaster.
:::

::: tab Chemistry
### Chemistry
The students are introduced to basic atomic theory, the Periodic Table, covalent and ionic bonding.
:::

::: tab "Science Fair"
### Annual Science Fair
Our Annual Middle School Science Fair is one of the highlights during Spring.  The students select scholarly science-related projects to work on independently and display their results at an Open House in our Gymnasium.

# Technology
SCA's extensive Technology programs start with Pre-K4 and continue through Grade 8.  

### Introduction 
Pre-K4 and Kindergarten students learn the basics of using the computer through the use of educational games that help them understand parts of the computer, how to use menus, and develop motor skills.  Kindergarten is introduced to Microsoft Office in the last marking period of the academic year. 

### Microsoft Office Suite
Students in Grade 1 through Grade 5 learn skills in using the four main programs included in MS Office:  Word&trade;, Excel&trade;, Powerpoint&trade;, and Publisher&trade;.  
When appropriate, students create projects that combine Technology learning with their other classroom subjects, such as Social Studies.  
MS Office Suite instruction utilizes the curriculum from <a href="https://globalacademics.com/" target="_blank">Global Academics</a>.  

### Google Education Suite
Students in Grade 6 through Grade 8 apply lessons learned from MS Office to similar programs offered in the Google Education Suite: Docs&trade;, Sheets&trade;,  and Slides&trade;.  
When appropriate, students create projects that combine Technology learning with their other classroom subjects, such as Social Studies. 
Google Education Suite instruction utilizes the curriculum from <a href="https://globalacademics.com/" target="_blank">Global Academics</a>.  Many area high schools are now using the Google Education Suite so as the students transition from Grade 8 at SCA, they are prepared to use either MS Office or Google Education Suite.  

### Coding
Students as early as Grade 1 are introduced to the concepts of Computer Programming / Coding.

Hour of Code is utilized for Grade 1 through Grade 5.  It provides an introduction for critical, logical thinking with block coding.

Python Programming is introduced starting in Grade 6 using Explorations in Coding I from <a href="https://edhesive.com/courses/explorations1">edhesive</a>.  Students apply logical thinking skills to creating real-life computer programs using the Python programming language.  

The goals of the course are:
- Introduce computer science as an engaging and relevant discipline.
- Develop foundational skills and knowledge in programming and computer science.
- Strengthen problem solving and critical thinking skills.
- Foster creativity, collaboration, and communication.
- Explore issues raised by present and future societal impacts of computing.
- Demonstrate that all students can be successful in computer science.



# Engineering
Engineering is woven into the Science and Technology curricula at SCA.  Both programs offer Middle School students the opportunity to use their God-given creativity along with the skills they have learned in Science and Technology to design and build machines and demonstrate them. 

## Annual Egg-Drop Event
Our students apply the skills they learned in physics to design and build their own protective devices to prevent an egg from breaking when dropped from the top of the long ladder on the Shrewsbury Fire Company Ladder Truck.   

## Robotics
Our students apply the skills they learned to design, build, and program robots using kit systems such as:  
  <a href="https://www.birdbraintechnologies.com/" target="_blank">Hummingbird from Birdbrain Technologies</a>, LittleBits and <a href="https://sphero.com/pages/activities" target="_blank">Sphero</a>.

# Mathematics
All grade levels learn appropriate grade-level mathematics skills.  Students apply these skills in their Technology, Science, and Engineering-related instruction and projects.  The curriculum is design so that students matriculating from Grade 8 to High School have the background needed to transition to high school Algebra.
