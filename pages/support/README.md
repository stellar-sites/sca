### How can a bequest be left to SCA?
You may name SCA as the beneficiary of a percentage of your estate, of a set dollar amount, or of a particular asset. Your estate is entitled to an estate tax deduction for the full value of your bequest to SCA. Another possibility is to name SCA as a contingent beneficiary of assets that you have designated for a loved one, should that person no longer be living at the time of your death. Please note: If you wish to benefit SCA through your will, I would be happy to work with you, your accountant and your attorney to discuss the best way to realize your goal.

### How is SCA designated for a bequest?
A detailed designation is preferred: SCA is a nonprofit tax-exempt organization, having as its principal address: 701 Windy Hill Road, New Freedom, PA 17349. Many estate assets are not transferred through your will. These include assets in your living trust, your qualified retirement plans, the proceeds from your life insurance, and annuities. You may name SCA as a beneficiary of any of these assets or as a contingent beneficiary in the event that the loved one you named as primary beneficiary is no longer living.

### Your Living Trust
Some people establish living trusts to provide for the current management of assets or for the future management of assets, should they become incapacitated. SCA may be named as a beneficiary of your living trust.

### Qualified Plans
These include your IRA, Keogh Plan, or other qualified retirement plan. Naming SCA as a beneficiary of assets remaining in your qualified retirement plans after your lifetime may be wise tax planning. Estate taxes and income taxes are avoided if a nonprofit organization, such as SCA, is named as the beneficiary. SCA generally will receive 100% of your plan assets.

### Your Life Insurance Policy
Designating SCA as a life insurance beneficiary is a simple and often used way to both support SCA and to gain tax advantages. The donation of a policy during life can give income tax benefits to the donor during his lifetime.

### Individual Policies
You may irrevocably name SCA as owner of a long-standing life insurance policy; or you may retain ownership and merely name SCA as the beneficiary. If you transfer ownership to SCA, you will receive an immediate income tax deduction for the lesser of your cost basis or the current value of the policy. Policies with loans may create taxable income to the owner. If you are employed, you may be receiving group term life insurance as an employee benefit. If so, SCA can be named as a beneficiary of the entire policy or as the beneficiary only of the amount that exceeds $50,000. If you wish to benefit SCA via any of these strategies, I would be happy to work with you, your accountant and your attorney to discuss the best way to realize your goal.

### Charitable Remainder Trusts
These trusts allow you to make a gift to SCA that will enable you and/or others to enjoy enhanced income for your lifetime(s) or a specified term of years. You choose the percentage payout you wish to receive (not less than 5%; not more than 50%).When your trust terminates, SCA receives the remaining principal.

There are two general types of charitable remainder trusts:
* Charitable remainder annuity trust. You receive a set dollar amount each year, equal to your chosen percentage of the trust's original fair-market value.
* Charitable remainder unitrust. Each year, you receive a variable amount, equal to your chosen percentage of the changing yearly value of the trust. Over time, a unitrust may allow some hedge against inflation.

Many types of assets can be used to fund charitable remainder trusts. These include:
* Cash
* Appreciated securities, real estate or collectibles
* Life insurance policies that you plan to sell (viaticate)
* Municipal bonds

### What are the benefits to you?
Substantial tax advantages may be available through the use of charitable remainder trusts. A charitable remainder trust can sell appreciated assets that you donate, without incurring the capital gains tax or income tax that would ordinarily be due on a sale. In other words, the full proceeds from the sale can be reinvested for your benefit. If you were to sell the assets yourself, the tax that would be payable on the sale could substantially reduce the principal available for reinvestment.

Your gift also generally entitles you to an immediate income tax deduction. In the case of gifts of cash or of stock or real estate that you have owned for more than a year, your deduction is equal to a percentage of your gift's fair-market value.
