# Admissions Policy

> Shrewsbury Christian Academy admits students of any race, color, national and ethnic origins to all the rights, privileges, programs and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. It does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, color, national and ethnic origin in the admission policies and school-administered programs.

Applications will be accepted for children from the age of three (3) years through the 8th grade. A copy of the child’s birth certificate is required for children entering Pre-Kindergarten 3 through first grade. Students applying for other grades will need to submit the most recent report card from their current school. Children transferring from other schools or beginning Kindergarten will be screened before placement.

::: warning
  Registration fees are to be paid annually and are non-refundable. These fees are not applicable to tuition.
:::

A personal interview may be requested with both parents and the student by a member of the Administration, and a parent agreement must be signed before enrollment is final.

Applications may not be accepted due to lack of space, or if we are unable to provide the necessary special education and facilities needed for children with learning disabilities. Also, applications may not be accepted based on prior academic or disciplinary history. All new students will be on a probationary period for the 1st marking period.

A child must be three (3) years of age by September 30th to be eligible for the Pre-Kindergarten 3 class. Likewise a child must be four (4) years of age by September 30th to be eligible for the Pre-Kindergarten 4 class and five (5) years of age for the Kindergarten 5 class. Any child entering the Pre K program must be potty trained. The age determination date is considered flexible only in special circumstances to be decided by the Head of School in cooperation with the grade teacher.
