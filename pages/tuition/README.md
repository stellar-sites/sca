As an independent, non denominational Christian school, Shrewsbury Christian Academy is primarily supported through the tuition which families pay as well as through donations from churches, businesses and individuals. As a nonprofit community Christian school, SCA relies largely on tuition income for operational costs and faculty/staff salaries.

SCA is overseen by a school board consisting of parents and local business people who carefully determine the yearly tuition rates based on projected yearly expenditures.
