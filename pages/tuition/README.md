# Tuition & Fees: 2019-2020

As an independent, non denominational Christian school, Shrewsbury Christian Academy is primarily supported through the tuition which families pay as well as through donations from churches, businesses and individuals. As a nonprofit community Christian school, SCA relies largely on tuition income for operational costs and faculty/staff salaries.

SCA is overseen by a school board consisting of parents and local business people who carefully determine the yearly tuition rates based on projected yearly expenditures.
